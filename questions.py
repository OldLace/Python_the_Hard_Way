# Complete the following exercises

# and total numbers used for the average:

# i. For Example: â€‹For numbers 44, 64, 88, 53, 89, when you run the file it
# should print something like: The average of 5 given numbers is : 67.6.

num1 = 44
num2 = 64
num3 = 88
num4 = 53
num5 = 89



total_sum = num1 + num2 + num3 + num4 + num5
average = total_sum / 5

print("The average of the 5 given numbers is: " + average)


# ii. 39, 45, 55, 90, 95, 96



# iii. 54, -45, -10, 90
